# Automatic-time-table-generator
The proposed Automatic Timetable Generator Software will help us to easily generate randomised timetables for each semester of each branch. It will also export it to easily distributable formats with separate views for Professors and students.

A key factor in running an educational centre or basically an academic environment is the need for a well-planned, well-throughout and clash-free timetable. Back in the days when technology was not in wide use, (lecture) timetables were manually created by the academic institution.

Every school year, tertiary institutions are faced with the tedious task of drawing up academic
timetables that satisfies the various courses and the respective examination being offered by the
different departments.

Timetable development process starts when each Head of Department provide the following
information to be used for timetable scheduling. The information provides the modules with dates,
time and venues suitable in a particular semester :
● Examinable courses in a particular semester.
● Dates for lectures to be held (Lectures can be scheduled between Monday and
Friday).
● Specified time for lectures ( i.e. Between 8am and 6pm)
● The venue of the scheduled lectures.

A timetabling problem consists of four parameters and they are:
a. T (set of time)
b. R (set of available resources)
c. M (set of scheduled contacts)
d. C (set of constraints)

This problem assigns time and resources to the contacts in such a way that the constraints will be
satisfied. In various timetabling problems, educational timetabling has been generally examined
from practical standpoint.
The quality of the timetable determines the quality of time dedicated by lecturers, students and
administrators to academic activities.
